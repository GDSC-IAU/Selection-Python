#SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 

This project aims to conduct sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using the TextBlob library, focusing on a selected product to gauge customer sentiments. By extracting and analyzing textual data from reviews, we will determine the polarity and subjectivity of each review to classify them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. This analysis will enable us to understand overall customer satisfaction, identify trends in feedback, and provide actionable insights for product improvement and targeted marketing strategies. Employing TextBlob's NLP capabilities, the project encapsulates data collection, sentiment analysis, and visualization to offer a comprehensive overview of consumer sentiment towards the chosen product, serving as a foundation for data-driven decision-making in enhancing product quality and marketing approaches.
