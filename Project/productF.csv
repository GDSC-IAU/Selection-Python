But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books.

The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",Shock value,positive

4380,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung.",Good little tablet,positive

Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:,great budget tablet,positive

I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues).

If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it.

The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!",Excellent value!!,positive

She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself.

I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival.

5680,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the ""back"" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called ""exPDF Reader"" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too.",great for serious annotation/scripture study,neutral

Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest.

I think the people who expect that are the ones who are disappointed by its features.I personally love this tablet. I wanted a tablet so that I could read, check emails, watch shows ( Hulu, Netflix, AMC), shop online and do some web surfing. I am a pretty simple gal. I did not expect much when purchasing this tablet. I assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor, that it would load pretty slowly, and that I would be unable to download most of the apps I wanted. It wouldn't have bothered me, being that I believe you get what you pay for ( and I could not afford an Ipad or Samsung at the moment). Boy was I proven wrong.I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment I turned it on. I have had other tablets ( and paid about the same) with terrible picture quality. I actually love watching my shows on this tablet because it is as if I am watching them on my television.This tablet loads pretty darn quickly. I have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck.I have been able to download EVERY app that I wanted, except Instagram ( oh well, no biggie). And me being the Amazon freak that I am, I was happy to see Amazon apps pre-loaded onto the tablet ( shopping, music etc. ).

And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me.

5900,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!",Awesome tablet for the price,neutral
5901,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"So with that said, I cannot complain. I purchased this so I could have something inexpensive, small and could throw in my purse or pocket to read school books on the go. I own an iPad Air 2. I paid $450 for that, so it's not fair to compare the two.Of course Amazon doesn't have the apps that Apple has. If you're looking for something to read books on, but to be able to hop online from time to time on a screen bigger than a smartphone, this is it.The screen resolution isn't top of the line, the audio isn't great, but you can watch Amazon video, youtube and other streaming services on this table.If you know the capabilities of this tablet, then you won't have your expectations set too high. With that said, comparing this to any other $49 tablet, this wins. With the low-end cost of this, if I had the finances, I'd find an under privileged school district and buy these for them. The features of setting these up for educational time for kids is great. If you haven't already exposed your kid to iPads, I'd recommend one of these.I think the Fire would also be good for someone who isn't a techy. I don't even consider the camera on this. They could have left that off of the device, but I suppose if you purchase one of these for grandma, she can use it to skype the grandkids.

6019,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you.",You get a lot for $50,positive

6027,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses.","4-star tablet, 5-star value",neutral
6028,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"Best bang for the buck! Although it may lack the processing power of the Ipad Mini, it has all the features and is 20% of the cost at $50.00. The battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. I bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. She was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. I was very pleased to find it had Bluetooth! The built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. Although it isn't listed HD, at 7 inches an SD picture is razor sharp. Colors are bright, and the unit is light. Although you can't (without a hack- google it, wink wink) get google Play apps, the Amazon Underground has 10k FREE apps.You can also upgrade to 128 gb of external storage.Won't give it five stars as the sound without external speakers or headphones is weak, and the speaker is placed on the back, but would say 4.5 stars.","Don't hesitate, get one today!",neutral

6037,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet?

You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price!

So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either.

I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports.

The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!",A Great Buy at $50,positive

7245,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,3.0,"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",Good for what it is,neutral

I haven't spent enough time on it to get what I need as efficiently as I can on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his Galaxy tab 8 (currently in use by our 10-yr-old son). Remotes are too complicated sometimes... our family joke anyway... but he'll sit down and browse the Amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and I haven't heard a complaint or call for help. I haven't even heard any annoyed-caveman sounds! I like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. May sound trivial, but my main complaint with both Galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged (bottom-portrait for the tab 8 and bottom-landscape for the tab 10.1 - either way, it hinders function). Functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the Fire tablet. When I'm ready for a new tablet, I'll probably get the Galaxy Pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the Kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated.

The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating.",Super little tablet,neutral

But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try.

9395,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!","Awesome entry level tablet, perfect for young kids",positive

9447,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,3.0,It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it.

9547,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness.","Useful Reader, Shopping Experience w App Quirks",neutral

I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet.

Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music.

The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"".

10604,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that. But you defintely get what you pay for",Nice basic tablet,neutral

I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it.

11145,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it.","Good Tablet, for the price",neutral

Highly recommend this tablet if you are looking for one for your child. Parental controls are very easy to use and provide a large number of options as far as limiting applications, time limits for use and curfew options. My children are very rough on these tablets and with the cases on them they have not caused any damage to them at all. Easy to set-up and install apps, decent battery life, decent battery charge time, great picture quality when watching netflix or other streaming media, wifi works very good, lightweight and easy to hold for extended periods of time, intuitive controls and user interface.

11631,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.",Amazing little tablet... even more amazing price!,neutral

This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote.

It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you).

12021,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!",I LIKE IT!!!,neutral

There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it.

I also has purchased the 2 year no questions asked insurance. I like that I can set time limits, when the device can wake and when it can sleep. How much time should be spent for educational work vs play or movies. I like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it costs in case either of my children decide to throw it across the room. I have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic devices can become air borne in a moments notice for no reason at all. So I am no longer willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet.Also, I had purchased a Galaxy Tab 4 and found that I couldn't use Amazon Apps on the secured profile side unless I installed the app on ""that"" side which would give my children access to purchasing apps. I was not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the Galaxy Tab 4. I also found that my older son wanted the Amazon apps from the Amazon underground store that my youngest son was playing. When I looked on Google Play for them, those same apps to put on the Tab 4 were $10 a piece!! Being they were Disney apps. Well, this tablet has virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my children are happy. I have insurance on both so I am not worried about them breaking them. I don't have to match $10 apps on another device. My children read books and watch movies, or play apps, so the internet isn't really a concern, as it is a little slow but not painful.Overall, I definitely would buy it again and I would recommend it.

All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet.

13633,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,5.0,"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you.

So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",Does not work with WowWee MiP app,neutral

A fairly decent and accurate battery. Sound is low in volume but reliable. Expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly.

After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run.

14400,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Amazon,4.0,"I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products.
