Echo (White),,,",Amazon,4.0,"I really enjoy the Echo. I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a Prime member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from Prime music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses Microsoft's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or Google would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around.","A Lot Of Fun, Well Made, Versatile, And Very Useful",positive

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,4.0,"I really enjoy my echo. I listen to music, audible books, weather, the news. I talk to my mom with it because I bought her one also. This had a really amazing speaker. It's really great with answering science questions and anything you can find on Wikipedia. The only down side is, Amazon doesn't have a sever like Google does. So there are a lot of questions you may ask that the Echo can't answer. I really recommend this if you have Amazon Prime or the Nest thermometer or any of those smart gadgets that can be controlled with Echo. If you don't have these items or Prime, I would get the Google Home. You can listen to music and books using the different Google apps. With the echo you can order from Prime. You cannot link the Echo with other Echo devices yet to play music on all of them at the same time yet. I'm hoping that will change with time.",I love this item,positive

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,4.0,"Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music. Part of the problem might be the many versions which exist for a given piece as well as the distinction between composer and performing artist.Overall, I would recommend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music, but don't expect perfection quite yet!",Great for music and a gateway to home automation,positive

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills.

The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it.

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,4.0,"I've had an Echo for a couple years now, and it is pretty slick in some cases and grossly frustrating at others. Playing music, setting timers, asking specific questions and overall home control works well. Whenever you ask it what seems like a simple question in some cases, she cannot answer. Sometimes she hears wrong and plays music that is beyond interesting. One thing I can say is that Amazon has been working to make Echo better and better.

Everyday new skills or software is available. After using this for a week, it has convinced me that a smart home is the future. One wish, it would be nice if I could turn on and off The nest thermostat through Alexia.

I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does. Everything is run through the Alexa App so just get your table out and use Alexa that way?I'm just not very happy with this purchase.

It is very continent to ask Alexa to turn off certain lights, set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger events through IFTTT. I really don't use any of the other features like creating lists or scheduling events, but I do use the timer function while I am in the kitchen.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 -Other devices cannot utilize my Echo's speaker, I would like for SmartThings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walks through a main entry door, or if my garage door opens, which I know other Wi-Fi connected speakers are capable of doing.Echo to Echo connectivity would also be a nice feature, being able to say ""Play music in all rooms"" or while standing in the kitchen ""Play music in the living room""",Great for Home Automation,positive

Alexa did work the distance, but I had to yell to penetrate through the walls for the lights on the other side of the house. As a team, they both work like a charm.

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice.Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls.",One word awsome,positive

I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!,Awesome sound !,positive

24570,"Echo (White),,,
Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"Coupled with Wink, this becomes an invaluable tool. I can't comment on audio quality as it's location is not ideal for sound. Voice recognition is the best I have used. Play CNN, Play x, Play y. It works very well. The Smart Home connection is really what I bought Echo for and it is fantastic. Make shopping list and see on your phone. Turn on x light or group of lights. Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well. I recommend Echo if you want a better sound for listening to music, but if you are connecting to your current AV system or are not putting in a location where audio quality is not required, go DOT. Oh and DOTs sound quality is acceptable for communication type audio.",Very good Smart Home Tool,

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"When I made this purchase, it was for what I thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music. I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!",EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS,

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"This is fantastic! We're finally tapping into the world of ""Smart homes"". However, with all the different devices, brands and apps it makes controlling all the devices a little bit cumbersome. So you can either get one brand and stick to it... OR... you could get this! The Amazon Echo consolidates and integrates ALL your devices. So now you can control all your devices, regardless of the brand, through the Echo. Also, the voice recognition is top notch.",Best thing ever,

I have a iPhone 6s and use Siri not as much as I would like too cuz she doesn't understand me all that great but Alexa? Man she understands every word I say like flawlessly. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Skills now even tho it's over 3000 skills a lot of them are junk people made I wish more big developers would make some. Should be well known Trivia games in here even if you had to buy them unless I'm not looking in the right place.

It should have separate volume levels for the 'Alexa' assistant and for music. When you play music at a lower volume then you can't even understand Alexa until you turn up the volume. 2.

The Echo is one of the coolest tech products we have ever had. It makes me feel like we are living in some futuristic home. Other than being an excellent Bluetooth speaker (which it is), Alexa sets timers, alarms, streams music through many different apps, tells you the status of your orders on Amazon, etc. We love it so much that we find ourselves searching for other products that pair with Alexa to enable it to do even more for us.

Echo (White),,,",Amazon,5.0,"I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo.

Amazon 9W PowerFast Official OEM USB Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders,,,",Amazon,3.0,"After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only).",Decent but lacking,positive

Mine on the other hand is awesome. just today alone, i used it as an alarm clock to wake up, turn on the lights and music to wake the kids for school, check how much gas was in my tank without going to the car, re-order toilet paper and laundry detergent for a price cheaper than the grocery store, hear the news headlines while drinking the coffee ""alexa"" made me when she turned on the coffee pot, roll a 20 sided die for a dungeons and dragons game with my one kid who managed to avoid summer school, pipe music into my home all day, order pizza for dinner, and get help with the kids algebra homework. After dinner we played jeopardy on it after the show aired, and used it to dim the lights inside, and turn on the porch lights outside when it got dark and i couldnt get up without disturbing my sleeping baby on my chest, who incidentaly fell asleep to the echo playing soothing music....she can also tell you facts about EVERYTHING you probably dont know, including starwars which pleases the kids, tells jokes, plays rock-paper-scissors, AND can call you an Uber. Have you tried activating her ever increasing fuctions via the alexa app?

The first one I have was placed in the living/kitchen area, as I use it to play music, add notes (a lot of items to my shopping lists) and appointments/reminders to my calendar. I love having a second Echo in the bedroom to give me the news brief in the morning, give me a status of the traffic and weather conditions, play music, etc. I've noticed a lot of imitations popping up by different companies, however, Echo is the best and has become an integral part of our house and lives. It sounds dramatic, but it's definitely true. Amazon constantly updates and adds new abilities/features. The ability to link it to lights, thermostat, etc. let's me think we are keeping up with the Jetsons! Highly recommend buying an Echo!",Easy to use and helpful!,positive

Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them.

The echo couldn't answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which I never asked for.Unless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isn't a good speaker.I did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer. Even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain. Some said maybe I got a defective unit which wasn't the case the echo is just limited in what it can do.I would say save your money this isn't worth it yet.,Not worth the money or time,positive

It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question. With Alexa, if you have not downloaded the ""skill"" then there is a chance that she won't understand.

Using these features as a selling point is disingenuous.More than that Google home constantly has trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant commands.

Yes sometimes if there is some noise or if you don't speak clearly she might get it wrong but most of the time she gets it right. My only flaw with Alexa is the music, which isn't a problem with the product it's self but when it comes to playing music other than Pandora- you do have to subscribe to unlimited music which is reasonably priced and is worth it but do wish it came with it.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights. Works great for off/on and dimming at a percentage but can't get the colors and scenes to work. Has to be SO exact with the naming of the lights and wording when you speak to Alexa. Also, making lists is JUST a shopping list. It would be great if I could add to an Amazon wish list instead! Seems like a natural!? Great for checking weather, sports and such. Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying. Looking forward to Apple's version of this. More expensive and still many months away, but since I have an Apple Music account and it will play MY playlists!

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"I purchase my Alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with its operation. Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do. My future plan is to interface Alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice control. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend Alexia to anyone.",Happy with my purchase,positive

We didn't anticipate enjoying it ourselves so much that I'm not sure we're going to be willing to let it go!!!Setup is dead simple if you already have an Amazon Prime account and wireless Internet access. The audio quality and the unit's ability to cut through ambient noise in order to hear you are remarkable. The device is solidly built and has several nice ergonomic touches such as the rotating, color changing ring of lights that let you know you are being heard to the rotating volume ring at the top of the unit.It is amazing what the Echo can do. I'll leave the voyage of discovery up to each of you. Do get used to hearing ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or ""I'm still learning about...."" but I am certain that the Echo's cloud based ""brain"" will only get better with time.Do yourself a favor and get one of these, the whole family will enjoy it!",My favorite tech product this year!,

25935,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"Having realistic expectations is a must with the Echo. I had thought the AI would be much better than it is. Sometimes you need to say something three times for Alexa to find it. For example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it. This is with voice training complete mind you. I purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house. They did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos. Be warned though if you ask Alexa to play your group (multiple echos) you cannot play all your devises at once using Spotify for example. Verbally asking Alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music. The Alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate. I feel Im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone. You need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back. I think most have the intention of buying the Echo, setting it up, and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup. Remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle. I gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank. I think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems Amazons priority isnt necessarily the Echo. From reviews Ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release. I was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if I would have paid full price I would have returned all three and saved my money. Wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product.",Getting Better,

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"I actually started with an Amazon Echo Dot to see how the whole thing worked without having to spend a lot of money. I was amazed at how cool and useful the Alexa system can be. We were using one Echo Dot to make lists, check the weather, set calendar appointments, set alarms, and even play rainstorm soundtracks to help sleep at night. My birthday was just a couple of weeks ago and my wife got me the Echo as the main Alexa hub in our living room. The built-in speakers sound pretty good for what they are. Definitely a huge improvement over the Dot's built-in speaker, but even the Dot has a nice sound for as small as it is. We now have 4 Echo Dots and the Echo to control all sorts of WEMO switches and outlets around the house. We already had a NEST thermostat which integrated nicely and easily. The best thing is that Alexa understands all of our different voices... even our 4 year old. He can now turn his bedroom light on by asking Alexa to do it so he doesn't have to be afraid of the dark! It really is a very cool and convenient system. My wife thought it was silly at first, but she actually loves it.

This little toy wakes me up every morning and together with her little sister help me avoid burning my food, stay up to date with news, play my favorite music, control Hue Lights, remember things, and read. I slowly grew attached to Alexa and now it's a part of my life that I probably cannot live without. The one thing that I don't do with it is shopping (sorry Amazon) and I shop a lot. I find it cumbersome and unintuitive. Perhaps you can use it to reorder things that you are already familiar with. The sound quality is good enough. Every morning Alexa plays some upbeat music to jump start my day. It's not as good as my UE Megaboom; it lacks bass. Granted, not that many people would expect audiophile music quality from Alexa anyways.The problem with Alexa is still its rather disappointing app selection--both quality and quantity. But I guess the few goods one still imo justify a purchase. My advice is to get one and try it out for a couple of weeks. If it grows on you, keep it. If not, say bye.

26166,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best. Oddly, Amazon Echo pairs better with my work accounts (GSuite/Google Apps for Biz) because Google Home doesn't do that yet. For home automation, Echo can't be beat. For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing. The skills, for now, are mostly useless or ""add-ons"" to the Flash Briefing. It can read your audio books and Kindle books (and they do a freebie monthly) - but as I listen at 3x speed to most of my audio books, it's not the most helpful thing ever (because there's no speed control yet).Is it the Computer from the Enterprise? Not yet. It can't perform complex tasks like, ""Alexa, find me a 4 or 5-star Chinese Restaurant nearby and make a reservation"", cannot call out (hey Skype, where are you?), and cannot send text messages or write emails.There's some connecting the dots that will have to happen for this to be life-changing, but for now, it's pretty good.",Cool? You betcha. Game-changing? Maybe.,positive

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,I was hesitant at first about this...but it turns out to be more than I expected. My only complaint is not getting it sooner.,Great Companion,
26168,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"I opted for the Echo over the Dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker, and because I planned to add Dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants. The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results.","So far, so good, with a couple of caveats!",positive

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"Up front I want to say that I actually returned the Echo in lieu of the Amazon Dot. They are both basically the same device but I did not need the extra powerful bluetooth speaker portion of it as I already have a great speaker at home which I hooked up to the dot and it works amazing. If you dont already have a bluetooth speaker, get the Echo, keep it simple, neat and its a great omnidirectional speaker. I am still amazed at how much power these little devices hold. I learn new ways to interact with Alexa every week and it makes my life easier and more entertaining. I highly recommend this in your home if you have kids, my 3 year old daughter now spends time asking Alexa questions when I am not available.","Awesome Invention, a must have!",

Then I decided I wanted a nice, compact music player for my office and started to evaluate options. After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day. It gives me the weather forecast, traffic status, miscellaneous information, but most of all, streaming music.And when the phone rings I can pause it quickly using the voice control and then resume when I'm done.

26289,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"As a Google Home user I was excited to try its direct competitor, Amazon Echo, since a lot of people that I know have an Echo and are enjoying theirs so far. The setup process is very simple and requires you to download Alexa App for your mobile device. The Alexa App definitely needs more improvement as I found myself having to relaunch the app at times to reconnect the Echo to my wireless network. Alexa has bluetooth connectivity which is great for streaming music from my iPhone, something Google Home does not have currently. The mic is very sensitive which I like so I don't have to speak too loudly to wake the Echo up and it picks up voice from the far end of the living room; the Echo is located in the dining room. Sound quality is pretty good and music did not have too much distortion at higher volumes.The Echo's is more on the heavier side which I like cause I feel the build quality is good. The Echo is tall so the tall black cylinder stands out in my dining room table. I like the 360 speaker and mic design. Volume control can be adjusted by twisting the top upper ring which is simple enough. Amazon Echo uses Bing for querying answers to your questions and this is definitely where I think Echo takes a hit. There were quite a few simple questions I asked Echo that Google Home had no problem answering. Google search is the best, bar none.One of the bonuses of Amazon Echo is surely felt if you are a Amazon Prime member. For example, I asked Echo to check my order status for items I ordered on Amazon and it told me I had items out for delivery today. Also you can ask Echo what are today's deals on Amazon and it asks whether you want to buy the item it mentions. There is a lot of potential and more benefits for Amazon Prime customers.Overall I really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo and I am impressed with the design and build quality. Amazon's usage of Bing for searching is definitely lacking compared to Google. This is a solid complimentary assistant for Amazon Prime Members. Bluetooth is a plus for sure.PROS: Solid build and design quality. Good audio quality. Sensitive mic. Perfect for Amazon Prime Subscribers.CONS: Amazon Bing search is not nearly as good as Google. Alexa App needs improvement.",Solid Sound and Mic Quality. Google > Bing Search,positive

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it.",Love Alexa!,positive

Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, ""Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen."" That ""does not compute."" But if you say, ""Alexa, shut off the lights."" She will do as you ask. I had to start writing down the ""correct"" way to ask her things so I would remember them. Again she needs to learn and adapt; not happening so far.",Not as Intuitive as Expected,positive

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).","Smart Enough, I Guess",positive

Nothing like saying, ""Alexa, can you ummmmmmm"" and it replies, ""WTH are you talking about?"" It really doesn't say that, but it might as well.

There are hundreds of Apps that you can download, that enables Alexa to do on your command.

There are so many different skills that is has something for everyone and while it is used for home automation there are many things you can do with it if you don't have any other connected home devices.

We've bought a couple of the smart outlets, and it's very convenient to say ""Gameroom on"" and have the lights and fireplace all come on without having to turn everything on, as our hands are often full when entering the gameroom. Also have it connected to Fitbit, so if I don't have my phone and the Fitbit is charging, I can just ask how I'm doing. Good weather reports and news briefs, and the best part is you can just say, ""Stop"" when you don't want to hear any more. Convenient saying aloud an item for a grocery or to-do list, then having it on your phone when you get to the store. We've also enjoyed the music (have it connected to speakers in the living room). Only drawback is it can't answer a lot of things. One example, I asked when the new Bladerunner was going to come out, and it could only give me info on the original show.",Very useful and a lot of fun!,

The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,3.0,"Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility. Kids play games with her, like 20 ?s, jeopardy, riddles, jokes, and daily Easter eggs. While the adults like smart concerts, sports highlights, news briefs and all the things your ""Siri"" can do, by more. Like turn on/off your lights, coffee maker, tv, and whatever else you hook your smart outlets to.(sold separately) Now for the ""Alexa bugs."" More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it. Overall, the gimmicks wear off, but we routinely enjoy smart concerts and our smart light system. soon we will be asking these robots to do our dishes, laundry, cook, or whatever else humans don't feel like doing.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"The echo has a small problem in that it is a blue tooth receiver only. You can blue tooth your devises to it, tablet , phone ,or other devices. It would be better if you could connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth. The dot can be connect to blue tooth speakers or blue tooth capable audio receivers. The Dot does have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it. The problem with the dot is if you use the included 3.5 mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker. This means you have to have the audio component on to hear the Dot. However the blue tooth connection on the Dot works great. I own a Marantz AV receiver with blue tooth. I tell Alexa to connect and it automatically turns on the receiver, set it to the correct input and is ready to play music or any other audio I want to listen to through the Dot. When I tell Alexa to disconnect it turns of the receiver and switches back to the internal speaker. If you are buying an echo device for a high quality music server using Amazon music then you want an echo Dot.If you want to listen to average sounding speaker that you can place just about any where in your house the Echo is a great product.",This is great except for one minor problem,positive

With very minimal training (5 minutes) she can call up music channels from Pandora, play her own music, ask about the weather and lots of other stuff that she may not do but could do.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"I have both Google Home and Amazon Echo. I also have a Harmony Hub and several smart home devices. I love the smart home integration and once you activate lights and your entertainment center with your voice, good luck going back. For now, the Echo has better integration with my smart home, but once Google Home catches up, I will be switching to Google for the sole reason I subscribe to Google Play Music.But to be honest all of these devices have limited uses and the ""fun"" or ""cool"" appeal wears off soon. It's fun to ask Alexa questions or ask her to tell you a joke, but that gets old quick. It's also cool to order something from Amazon, but I rarely do so because I like to look at what I'm ordering. The sound quality is passable for a small speaker. I prefer to send music to my receiver through other means (i.e. Google Home and Chromecast Audio). At the end of the day, it's a fun device to have that provides some useful ""skills"" (ordering Dominos is cool, but I've only done it once) and games (I like Jeopardy) but it's true usefulness is its ability to be the voice hub for your smart home, if you're interested in having one...","Easy to use and fun, but limited appeal",positive

We have HUE lights in 3 rooms of our house which operate with a phone app. They are great (I definitely recommend them also), but it is wonderful to be able to ASK to have the lights turned on when you need to go to the kitchen in the dark or when your hands are full...or at night when you need all the lights off.

My wife is an average PC and smart phone user and has been gracious enough to put up with my desire to add automation to my home. Hands down we both agree that adding this was the best decision ever. Prior to adding the Amazon Echo to our home we would have to use the controller on the wall or an app on our phones to control lights, door locks, garage doors and thermostats. With a little bit of searching online you can find all the help you need to get Alexa linked to your other services and accounts. My Wink home automation shortcuts can now be set off by voice command. When I walk in the door with my arms full I simply say ""Alexa, turn on entry lights"". When it is time for the kids to get settled down I say ""Alexa, trigger reading mode"" and all lights are set to the desired levels. Time for bed? ""Alexa, trigger night mode"" and all lights shut off, garage door closes (if left open) and all deadbolts lock on exterior doors. Ask ""Alexa, what's up?"" and she gives current time, temps, forecast and top news. When we sat down with the kids to open Christmas gifts... ""Alexa, play some classic Christmas music"". No, I don't work for Amazon... I'm simply amazed at how far things have come.

When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right.

I was slightly less impressed with it only because I wasn't an amazon prime member, which limits is productivity. If you want a full experience with Alexa, you have to be a prime member. Since I mostly use google products already, it made sense for me to get the Home - which to me is a little bit more functional than Alexa only due to the Google search engine.Overall, if you're in the market for such a connected device, you can't go wrong with either",Great product,

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,1.0,"I purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners. However, when I got home and attempted to set up the device, it was frustrating and the instructions/FAQs were not very helpful. The echo could not find my NEST thermostat, nor could it find about half of my HUE lights. Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it. Once she found all of my lights, she would turn them on or off, but would not change colors or brightness levels. I run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life. This should not have been this quirky. I would not recommend this item. Get a Google Home.",Not intuitive - Overly argumentative.,

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,1.0,"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer.",Disappointing,positive

If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement.","Doesn't answer ""Google"" type questions",negative

Alexa voice control is good for playing music, asking about the weather, adding things to a list, setting timers, etc. The only downside is that she is much more limited in her knowledge than Siri is, she can't play from iTunes or apple music, or connect to iPhone notes.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,5.0,"Echo is great fun particularly if you have connected devices like Wemo or Lifx bulbs or Next thermostat. At first you think you may not use that much, then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat, like when you are cooking and your hands are messy. I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with. Lifx bulbs have direct integration, but you can't change the colors without IFTT I think, and Nest thermostat has direct integration.

There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course.

I don't think you'll be disappointed with the hardware or AI but it is difficult to add extra capabilities or ""skills"" through the necessary app because you have to scroll through all of them sequentially. The developers should add categories or a search function by capability. Last I checked there were 2 other models will the same AI capabilities and at lower price points.

Works really well, however I didn't realize she can't control the WEMO bulbs. Hopefully this is something that will come soon.

I just purchased a voice remote to go along with the Echo so I can control it from my bedroom while it is in the kitchen. A few times when attempting to turn the living room light on or off Alexa replied with ""Ok,"" but nothing happened.

Because of its open source code you can add skills that other users have developed or download a SDK and make your own. It reads me bedtime stories filters my content for news sources according to my whim add complex sums, spells and is an all around good sport. But the best thing is -- I had a few remote control hubs around wink, nest the house because I hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than completing the task myself.

I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo!

27842,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Amazon,4.0,"First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor. But the potential is there and it looks like Amazon is working on it.",Great Can't wait to see where it gets better.,positive

Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result.

27909,,Amazon,5.0,"Originally figured this would be almost a toy, but as I easily started connecting the Echo to my existing home automation components I realized this would become a key part of my home. Throw in the different connections the Echo can make (with my car, for example) and you now have an essential component to your day...absolutely worth it!","More than a convenience, a must-have",positive
27910,,Amazon,4.0,The capabilities of this product are absolutely amazing. I truly only wish that it could integrated with other product lines such as Google based products.,Awesome Product,
27911,,Amazon,4.0,Still needs more compatability for things it controls. Needs some sort of access to maps,Good,
27912,,Amazon,5.0,Great product the kids love it. We use it for music and news. Kids love to ask it to tell them jokes,Amazon Alexa,positive
27913,,Amazon,5.0,Wonderful speaker that is easy to use. I have parred it with both my IPad and IPhone and it works great with both!!,Great speaker!!,
27914,,Amazon,5.0,This was a birthday gift for my daughter but I must say I want one for myself! Great sound and easy to operate.,Great Sound!,positive
27915,,Amazon,5.0,"Echo has surprised me in many ways. While the features are nothing new, the ability to access them through pure voice control has been incredible.",Very innovative product,
27916,,Amazon,1.0,"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it).",Seriously Needs Improvement - Overrated!,positive
27917,,Amazon,5.0,"I love Alexa. I've purchased the light/other electronics control wall plug ins and now not only can Alexa keep me company, play my music, and basically be my personal assistant but she can turn on/off my lights and electronics when I ask. Next is to purchase the thermostat. I'm sure there is more to come.",New Best Friend,positive
27918,,Amazon,5.0,So easy to use and entertaining....I love this product,Love it,positive
27919,,Amazon,5.0,"The Echo is awesome and fun. We use it to control TV,s Thermostats, Lights, and Stereo all with voice commands. Anyone using amazon prime will like the voice ordering. We find something new everyday that the echo will do.",I Love This Thing.,positive
27920,,Amazon,4.0,"I've been playing with this for a few weeks. It is not perfect, but it is great for listening to music and audiobooks. I don't like watching the news, so the ""Flash Briefing"" is very nice. Sometimes it does not get the full headline, but I get the gist of it, and I don't have to go through the depressing details. I'm looking forward to learning how to create my own skills for it. The speaker isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's definitely not the worst. The IFTTT integration is great, and I have setup triggers to many devices in my house and the Shopping List is great.",Fun Device,positive
27921,,Amazon,5.0,"This device sounds great and has plenty of volume, enough for outside use. It connects to Amazon Prime music and also to Pandora. I also purchased a battery base so that it is portable.","Great sound, nice connectivity",
27922,,Amazon,5.0,"Once it is programmed, it works great! It is a wave for the future for voice programming.",Easy to Use,
27923,,Amazon,3.0,"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience.",Not as great as I expected,positive
27924,,Amazon,5.0,"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",I love my Echo!! Wouldn't do without it now.,positive
27925,,Amazon,5.0,"As an Amazon prime member I figured this would be cool to play my Amazon Prime music, but it's also a Bluetooth speaker that I can play My XM radio or iTunes through. Alexa is getting smarter and know my voice better with every question. She has my appointments and traffic and weather covered every morning. Great item here and great sounding speaker.","How did I live without ""Alexa""",positive

27960,,Amazon,4.0,"Great price, bought it to work with home automation products but haven't purchased those yet, that's next. Couldn't pass up the price and had points as well. We bought one with multiple accessories for our son last Christmas and he likes using the automation products. Generally similar to asking Siri things in an iPhone question wise. I like being able to add things to a shopping list and view then on my phone at the store. Still get several 'I don't know's' so only 4 stars so far. Probably a learning curve on our part too. Also good for cooking and converting measurements quickly. Like being able to control music and volume from my phone also.

27965,,Amazon,5.0,"Awesome product, fell in love with it the minute I turned it on",awesome,positive
27966,,Amazon,5.0,"I was NOT expecting this product to perform so well. Sleek design,compact, and easy installation make this product well worth the money. The only thing I was a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name..yet..and you cannot connect it via Bluetooth to a soundbar/extra speaker. The overall performance of the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly great though. I just wanted more. I got over not being able to add more speakers pretty easily though. It's that good. I might suggest however adding a Harmony Home hub with it so you can REALLY take advantage of the voice features. It was my understanding that the echo can pair with the hub so you can control more items. I'm going to set that up today so it is NOT verified just yet.",Wow,positive
27967,,Amazon,5.0,Works very well I'm adding more home automation because of this.,Better than expected,

There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It ""hears"" me very well - even from the other room.

27973,,Amazon,2.0,"Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime. Dropping the personification, music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time. The database Amazon Echo draws from is very limited: Alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common woman's shoe size is; what Serena Williams' age is but not how many guns Ruger sold last year. Stand by for more tech-savvy companies to take the Echo concept to maturity.",Good Music Fidelity & Voice Recognition,

Of course it has its novelty items like telling you jokes to singing you happy birthday. Truly this is the beginning of having an 'Iron Man' home.

My kids love that it has a quite extensive poot library. (something I never thought i'd say) One warning! It gets expensive quick. I had it two days and was already back at Best Buy buying a Phillips Hue Starter Kit so I could control my bedroom lights by voice. Not mention that you can order using Amazon Prime by voice.

I was blown away by the quality of the sound and the quality of the controls. I put it up their with Sonos and Bose as far as sound. The voice activations and commands have never failed to work for me and at full volume she can rattle some windows. The only drawback is it is not portable and requires an outlet to operate. Otherwise, you can't go wrong.",Having a Love Affair with Alexa,

I LOVE IT!!!It is so sleek and loud and crystal clear! I love waking up and asking Alexa to tell me the weather forecast and news updates. The music sounds awesome too! But let me tell you the ""magic"" of this echo... I had to go to Italy for a family thing and my hubby couldn't take the time off of work so I went without him (sad face)The best way for me to show him how much I missed him was to wake him up with our favorite song! That's right folks I would wake my husband up from 1000's of miles away with a touch of a button on my cell phone!!He sent me a text ""is that you?"" Wow!!! I couldn't believe it.So enough said just go out and buy one!!",Great speaker and loads of fun,positive

28037,,Amazon,4.0,This is great for things like Pandora and playing music from your Amazon library by just asking Alexa. I also was able to get a thermostat that was compatible and can have Alexa change the temp by asking her to. Wemo devices are touch and go. Sometimes after a wemo firmware update they do not work. Also it could use a line out to hook up to a receiver like the dot does. Note it works with Spotify if you have a premium account only not the free one.,Nice little item,positive

While I am shaving in the bathroom, I call out and ask about the weather and it tells me it. How convenient is that!","Fun, always there assistant",

There will be many times she will not understand what you're saying which can be both frustrating and hilarious. Alexa, put tomatoes on my shopping list.

With amazon prime (or Spotify, if that's your preference) I have almost every song that I'm interested in hearing without having to pay for anything. I haven't had the guts to order anything with it, but I'll work up the nerve eventually when I'm out of diapers or something easy.",Great product if you have Amazon Prime or Spotify,
28079,,Amazon,4.0,"It is easy to set up and use. It was surprising how well it could answer some random questions. I did make the mistake of telling my grandchildren, ages 3-8, how to use it. When they visit we hear Alexa answer ""how much does the earth weight"" dozens of times and have to listen to ""Kidsbop"" music. (That's right, we have no control over them.)",FUN AND EVEN USEFUL,
28080,,Amazon,5.0,Bought it for the bedroom. Now I have to buy another for the family room.,Excellent personal assistant.,
28081,,Amazon,5.0,The Amazon Echo is the missing link to the complete smart home strategy. A must get for anyone looking to unify their smart home devices into a sensible and easy to use gadget.,The Future Is Here,
28082,,Amazon,2.0,Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.,Still needs improvements,positive
28083,,Amazon,5.0,"We love our echo, Alexa! We use her all the time. Synched to our phones, and she's almost more helpful than a spouseRecommend this to any and everyone",Best thing ever,positive
28084,,Amazon,5.0,"So, at first, I wasn't sold on this. I bought it mainly to act as voice control for my Lutron lights on our first floor and I already had Pico remotes throughout, so it didn't get used that much. Then, it kind of clicked with some simple things like setting timers and playing podcast. Then, it got more natural when I connected the Alexa app and the Logitech Harmony app with IFTTT. Next thing you know, my wife and my son are both using it as we're coming and going to turn the lights off and on, turning on the TV, turning off when it's time for dinner etc etc. Really excited for the upcoming Sonos integration... All in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase as it's become a really strong platform for home automation and it only looks like it's going to get better.I think it's safe to say that the Echo means different things to different people... if you're into HA, then don't hesitate!",I've turned a corner,positive
28085,,Amazon,4.0,I really think it's awesome that it controls light thermostat and such I haven't bought any of these items yet but overall it's very helpful it's a nice tool to have at home it's hands-free you can ask questions overall I'm very satisfied with it,So far so good,
28086,,Amazon,4.0,"I do love the Echo. I loved it so much, I bought 2 plus a tap. The only / biggest problems are that some times she doesn't hear / understand me. Also, she doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to my stereo. Otherwise, we use it all of the time.",Love it',positive
28087,,Amazon,5.0,"So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, ""Alexa, bedroom light 10%"" or ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"" or ""Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify"", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported! Very, very cool technology!",4.5 Stars w/the benefit of updates over time!,positive
28088,,Amazon,5.0,"I was hesitant to buy the Echo, but waited until it was on sale. It's great for music and ties to Amazon Prime or Bluetooth to your phone. Unfortunately, it needs to be plugged in at all times to be powered on.",Great Amazon Product,

28091,,Amazon,4.0,i am amused buy what i know of this and nowrealize much of what echo can do depends on how i research the resources and how much iinput information. the bluetooth possibilities are something i would like to know more of and how to use them.,an interesting gadget with untold possibility,positive
28092,,Amazon,3.0,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",Nice speaker with extra features,positive
28093,,Amazon,5.0,Love this product. Been thinking about purchasing this for quite a while and very happy I finally did,Great for everyone,

28095,,Amazon,5.0,"Got this for my wife's birthday but the grandkids and I use it more. The grand kids use it to spell, we don't get the "" how do you spell this"" anymore, which is worth the price alone. This unit does so much more sound machine, alarm, timer, reminder, it even calls my wife,s phone when she looses it. Best purchase I made in a long while Love it.",Excellent item,positive
28096,,Amazon,4.0,"I purchased the Echo as a Deal of the Day for $130. At this price it is worth it. I have learned only simple things so far (Prime Music, weather, daily Jeopardy questions and getting it to tell jokes). But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things.",Nice Gadget,positive
28097,,Amazon,2.0,I think Ok Google can do the same or more. I found annoying by saying Amazon or other echo names repeatedly to get some answers if you get them. May be in future I may try when it is more practical,Good Idea but far from practical use.,

While this is not flawless, it works pretty good! It is on the bleeding edge so some challenges are to be expected. The apps for Echo appear to be growing, I just hope development continues. Next on list would be the harmony controller so that I can start to ingrate TV and Audio controls using Echo!

Just go to your Alexa app, on your phone or tablet and see what's new this week.",Wanted one of these for a long time,
28141,,Amazon,5.0,"Works great and constantly updated and improving. I use it to turn on my lights, my fan and adjust my two thermostats. I also ask it to play my favorite talk radio and more. Will pick up more for other parts of the house.",Automates my home,

28151,,Amazon,5.0,"I now have 3 Bedroom,kitchen and shower area and I will be getting one for the media room in the future. I think that says it all. The only down side is since it's operations is in the cloud, if Amazons servers go down then it's a brick but you can connect to Bluetooth on the phone and also use it as a Bluetooth speaker. There is one thing they could fix and that is when the volume is up high then if you try to talk to the Echo, it can't hear you and you'll have to manually turn it down.",The best with a few minor flaws,

28154,,Amazon,4.0,"I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.",Great sound in the kitchen,positive
28155,,Amazon,5.0,I got this as a gift and I must say the sound is better than my Bose speaker. I not only listen to music but it turns my lamp on when I ask.

28167,,Amazon,5.0,I have my Echo setup in my kitchen as that is where I get the most use of it. There is a learning curve to figuring out its limitations and getting it setup though. After that it is a fun device to use like I can add things to my grocery list or play a podcast or play Prime Music or turn on lights or give me the weather and sports scores. I am slowing setting my home up to have connected devices and this was a great starting device. I would say if you have spotty internet service this thing will not work but when you are on DSL you get what you pay for right?,Alexa the Nice Assistant,positive

28285,,Amazon,5.0,"We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying ""Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly.",Excellent Product You Didn't Know You Needed,positive
28286,,Amazon,5.0,Sound is crisp. Alexa is always on point. We love it.,Great sound.,positive
28287,,Amazon,4.0,"The echo works well, has good sound and is an interesting concept. Where it falls short is in the quality of the search results.

28291,,Amazon,5.0,The echo is pretty fun to use but is definitely more useful when paired with other smart home devices. I can control my Lifx bulb and my Ecobee smart thermostat with voice commands. She's also programmed with some funny lines and is fun to chat with to see what she says.,Alexa is awesome,
28292,,Amazon,4.0,I have owned the echo for about a month now and it has worked great.

28295,,Amazon,5.0,"I bought the Echo and a few Hue light bulbs when the radio that I use to listen to NPR new in the morning died on me. I've been very happy. I didn't even have to set it up to find my radio station! I just said, ""Alexa, listen to 88.9 FM,"" and she did it. Just like that. My kids ask her to check their math problems for their homework. We use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The lighting set up was super easy. Alexa is a nice addition to our family.",Love it.,positive

28302,,Amazon,4.0,The Echo is easy to use but some features require a lot of work. It is easy to set up for playing music.

Long learning curve but a fun product.,A fun product.,
28303,,Amazon,4.0,The Echo is a fun new tool to easily interface with the information highway. But there is a learning curve to navigate in order to be able to get the most out of the Echo. Sometimes Echo does not understand your requests. So you have to be able to restate certain requests.,A fun new product,
28304,,Amazon,4.0,"Takes getting use to asking the questions in the right way. Alexa is still learning so at times can be frustrating when asking questions. Great for music, weather, dates, and schedule requests. Its an entertaining companion when your home and enjoying some private time.",impromtu information when you need it.,positive
28305,,Amazon,5.0,"Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work.

28332,,Amazon,3.0,"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application.",First experience with AI,positive

28334,,Amazon,4.0,"I waited to buy this product, to see what the reviews would have to say over time. They were mostly upbeat, and I am an Amazon Prime member. So, I said, ""What the heck,"" and gave the Echo a shot. I am glad I did. I use it to listen to music and news intermittently throughout the night while sleeping. I enjoy the Sports Update and the Flash Briefing. I also like that I can simply ask to stream most any radio station, and listen to the latest episode of my favorite pod casts. Echo is very responsive to my voice commands. This product is easily worth every penny you spend on it.","Echo is fun, and worth the money!",positive

28336,,Amazon,5.0,"Very intuitive to use, works great with the Amazon ecosystem.",Great Product,
28337,,Amazon,5.0,"I'd been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time. Best Buy had a Deal-of-the-Day on these and I thought, what the heck, here's a table radio you can talk to. It does a whole lot more than that, and there is quite a learning curve, not so much in how to use it, but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful. The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so ""store"" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana. With all the alarms, timers, shipment trackers, wall street reports, entertainment updates, etc, it's like living with a gifted, less snooty concierge. I like it and would buy another if this one ever broke.",Good Fun,positive

28361,,Amazon,4.0,"I haven't had the Echo for very long, so I'll need to spend more time on its capabilities. I've used it primarily for music. Alexa's great at understanding my requests - when they're from Amazon Prime music or music I purchased through Amazon. I've struggled so far with trying to get her to play music from my extensive I-Tunes music - even though I have an IPod Touch paired with the Echo. I'll have to keep trying.I've also used Alexa for setting timers and some basic questions. She's not very good at some questions - especially if they're too long. Anyway, I look forward to playing with Alexa some more. So far, I'm happy with my purchase.","Pretty fun toy, but I mostly use it for music",positive

28364,,Amazon,5.0,"Amazon echo better known as Alexa is much more than a smart speaker. To unlock its true music potential, one should have amazon prime.

28375,,Amazon,5.0,I absolutely love my echo because I am lazy to log on my computer to ask google. Also I get multi use of it as my personal Pandora music box. The only downside to this is Alexa can't hear you if your room is big because of echoing in the background....also I forgot her name once and had to walk next to her to turn her off. Other than that...I love her!,Love my echo,positive
28376,,Amazon,5.0,The Echo is so much fun and versatile. It continues to grow with more apps that are constantly being developed.,Fabulous item!,
28377,,Amazon,4.0,"I love the voice response, it makes multitasking better! I could just say ""Alexa, volume 10"" it raises the volume all the way.

28383,,Amazon,4.0,It's a very cool device to have and control home items by voice. It's limited to its capabilities but updates to include things you wish it did like the recent add to calendar reminders and alarm. Love cutting on my lights on by voice (beats the clap on lol).

28388,,Amazon,5.0,"Amazon has been marekting this via emails to me for a while. Didn't think much of it at first until I found out this works well with home automation. I have almost every light in my home ""connected"" using a Smartthings hub. I look so cool to my friends that have never seen an Echo before. With a quick command I can turn on or off any of my connected lights one by one or use an IFTTT command to turn everything on or off. Yes, it works with IFTTT!!! You can get pretty creative with it. Having a multi-level home, I can command Echo/Alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my Ring doorbell :). This is one cool device for lazy people like me LOL. I use it to get the weather, traffic, sports scores (Go Warriors!), and create/add items to my shopping list. It plays music from numerous streaming music services but being a Prime Member and having used everything from Pandora to Spotify I find Prime Music the best for my taste in music. It's also free with my Prime Membership so I don't have to listen to ads or get stuck not being able to skip a song I don't particularly like. I've also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory. I leave the Echo in my dining room/kitchen area and I can send commands to Echo from my bedroom without a glitch. I can't wait for my Echo Dots to arrive. Call me an Echo fanatic but I tell you...it's an awesome piece of technology. And it keeps getting better as Amazon continues to develop and add new features. My only gripe is that I can't control my home security system with it. Simplisafe just doesn't want to play with anyone...boo!",Great device for the connected home!,positive

She tells me a funny fact every morning after I say ""Alexa, good morning"" then I tell her to play my favorite wake-up song(Good Morning Starshine) followed by the local weather and morning news. I get free music all day long from Amazon Prime and I can always hear a Chuck Norris joke. The sound quality is amazing, comparable to a Bose system and it was perfect for our last party. I get updates all the time for new stuff Alexa can do. I love my Echo and find it endlessly fascinating!",My New Best Friend!,positive
28450,,Amazon,5.0,"I was in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen. The Echo has been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home. You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. ""Amazon, play {insert artist here}..."" and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore.

28453,,Amazon,5.0,"First of ALL is Alexa understand me well especially with my diction accent not like Siri, Google, Cortana and other. They are all confused due to my accent but not Alexa.

28454,,Amazon,5.0,"Everyone love asking Alexa questions. She has earned her place in the middle of the livingroom now.

28459,,Amazon,5.0,"It's a great technology device and the voice recognition system works great! I can control my house thermostat and yard sprinkler system from the Echo. Echo can also be setup to control the lighting in the house as well. Echo also provides some entertainment for the kids when they ask her random questions and receive comical answers. I have to say it's really nice to just read my shopping list to Echo and have it on my phone for when I go to the grocery store. I've also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo as my alarm clock and weather station. If it's searchable on the Internet, Echo can usually answer your questions. Even though it still needs some fine tuning it's still a wonderful new piece of technology.",Great way to integrate household technology,
28460,,Amazon,4.0,"Alexa works better than expected. Recognizes commands but wish it would make an audible nosise whether or not it is able to perform a function. Sometimes it just dead silence. The app can use more features like more favorites mappable locations than just to ""work"". Overall, not bad for being its first model.",Great start,positive
28461,,Amazon,4.0,"it can answer very easy questions, but anything more advanced it does not understand. You have to be very specific, for example you can ask whats in a martini, but you cant ask how do I make a martini. Its got room for improvement.","Fun toy, but still needs some work",
28462,,Amazon,5.0,"Amazon did it on this one. I love my Echo, from checking the weather to asking random questions. I plugged mine up at the store and played with it for 30 mins with other customers and employees. This thing is a must.",Echo is the future,positive

28464,,Amazon,3.0,If it understands your question it works quite well. I enjoy it for music and basic knowledge.,Alexa has a hard time understanding me.,

28466,,Amazon,5.0,This is an awesome device. It does everything advertised and then more! Weekly updates on new features are great to receive. No complaints.,Love the Echo,
28467,,Amazon,5.0,"This is a great addition to any technological home. We don't use it all the time but we use it daily. It has a hard time recognizing my location when we ask for the weather, but we can ask for our city weather and we get it. We use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for groceries. It plays music that we ask. Now we must get some of the switches and plugs for controlling your lights and home automation. That will be a while, but it is still cool to know it is there as an option. Overall this is a cool toy for the whole family.",Great Addition,
28468,,Amazon,4.0,"Wish it could do more without subscribing to Amazion Prime. Bought this for my 19 year old daughter. She likes it a lot, but I think it could be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service.",Good product,positive

28471,,Amazon,5.0,The Amazon Echo is a fantastic assistant and helps organize my busy day.,Excellent,
28472,,Amazon,4.0,"I was intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try. I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one. You won't have buyer's remorse.",Cool Toy,
28473,,Amazon,5.0,"I got this to use as basically a speaker, but it does so much more! I use her all the time for setting timers, making shopping lists, turning off and on lights.

I would recommend this to everyone. We love it!",So far it's been fantastic!!,positive
28474,,Amazon,5.0,"Every day Alexa learns new skills.

28476,,Amazon,2.0,My hubby bought this for me since I was constantly googling questions on my phone. I was so excited to start asking it questions..... the only problem is Alexa doesn't have any of the answers. Music sounds great on it but that's about it. Not impressed. Save your money.,Over priced blue tooth speaker,

28481,,Amazon,5.0,"This piece of tech. is amazing and functional. I liked it so much specially in the morning to check weather, news and listen to some music. High qulaity and solid.",Indispensable,positive
28482,,Amazon,2.0,I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand,Not impressed,negative
28483,,Amazon,4.0,The Amazon Echo is worth purchasing. I wish it could access a wider variety of music and information.,Quality product with limits.,positive
28484,,Amazon,3.0,Had to spend 2 hours on line to make it work on line.,Not so good computer.,

28486,,Amazon,4.0,Alexa makes this worth it. AI is intelligent and does get smarter as you talk to it. She has some jokes too. This works even better with a Prime membership. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't fond of the tube. I can see myself knocking it down. The sound wasn't full or rich enough for me compared to Bose.,Smart,positive
28487,,Amazon,5.0,I got it because it is very helpful. Just by calling her name and on top of that ANYTHING you ask her she has the answer. It's like always having someone to talk to. I love my Amazon Echo!,Wonderful friend,positive

28493,,Amazon,5.0,"It literally speaks for it self!!! It's awesome to have something update me on news and entertainment! And the fact that it uses spotify for music as well, that's to awesome. I got it on my Birthday and told Alexa ( the echo's name) it was, and she said, "" happy Birthday"". That's Show's how personal it can get, then the other voice active products. The speaker works almost to well! I live in a 2 story town house, and the voice command can work as I'm walking down stairs. Just check the product out for yourself. You will want one!",Its a awesome product!!!!,

28496,,Amazon,5.0,"I heard about the Echo but thought it was another electronic gimmick I really didn't need (hard for an e-junkie to say no). My brother visited a few weeks ago and convinced me it was worth it so we found one at the local Best Buy and bought it. It's odd how many times we walk by now and ask questions.

28503,,Amazon,5.0,"I'm a techie. I love cool products.The Echo is a wonderful addition to the home automation revolution.Besides the home automation benefits, the sound quality is superb for the size. I love being able to play music, change the volume, and get updates all via voice. I would like to see some additional updates to how you can interact (without having to say Amazon or Alexa to trigger).Recommend it highly!!!",Awesome,positive
28504,,Amazon,4.0,I love the echo!!! It like you having a conversation with someone.,Great Product,positive
28505,,Amazon,4.0,"It's fun being able to ask Alexi questions. There is a lot she can do, but it takes time to figure it out unless you are tech savvy.",Fun thing to have,
28506,,Amazon,3.0,"I am an Amazon fanboy. I'll say it right up front. This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.","Nice ""tecky"" device, limited functions",
28507,,Amazon,5.0,Great voice recognition - super easy to set up - the closest you'll get to the computer on the Enterprise!,Amazing technology!,positive
28508,,Amazon,5.0,"Hands free operation at it's best. I have my Philips Hue hooked up to it (operating my kitchen and family room lights) as well as Pandora, iHeartRadio and my Nest. I have been using it for the past two weeks and I love it. The only issue I have experienced so far has been when I asked Alexa to turn on my family room lights, only one of the two bulbs turned on. This however, might be an issue with the Philips Hue hub. Other than that this has worked out great.",Great device,positive
28509,,Amazon,4.0,"I purchased the Amazon Echo to augment my other smart devices. Boy, has it made me lazy. Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life. Amazon is working on it though - I receive weekly emails about new things you can do with Echo.","Oh Alexa, you've spoiled me..",
28510,,Amazon,5.0,As a speaker it just does the job where it excells is as a home automation controolled,its amazing,
28511,,Amazon,5.0,"Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room"" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited.",Awesome speaker with lots of potential,positive
28512,,Amazon,5.0,I never knew our family would enjoy the Echo so much! My wife wanted one bad and Mother's Day was quickly approaching.

28516,,Amazon,4.0,"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps.",Very Nice Product for the Family,positive

I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all.",Careful,positive

28532,,Amazon,5.0,"The Amazon Echo works well. So well, in fact, that I haven't felt the need to use the remote very often. However, there are a few occasions when it is great: 1) When listening to music, getting the volume just right using voice commands can get annoying. The remote is quick, easy, and allows greater fine-tuning. 2) When there is a lot of background noise. The Echo is good, but sometimes has difficulty hearing correctly when I have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise. Speaking into the remote never fails (and also doesn't require you to say the wake word). 3) When in another room. I often listen to music on my Echo, even when in another room. Yelling across the house is disturbing, and doesn't always work, but the remote allows me to skip, pause, or turn off the music from my office or bedroom. It's also great for adding items to the shopping and to-do lists.If I lost my remote or, more likely, dropped it in the kitchen sink, I'd buy another without hesitation.","Little used, but much appreciated! 277 people found this helpful.

28533,,Amazon,4.0,"Or at least a future I'd like to be living in :-)Lets get this straight. As a Prime member, you can get this for 99. At that rate, think of it as:- A wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to!- An alarm clock that you can shout at (Alexa! Shut up!) in the morning, and it will obey you :) (its my half asleep morning power trip)- Set a timer for when you're cooking- Fact check your friend while you argue with them :PSo my common use cases aside, here's what is good about Echo:- Speech recognition works *really* well, esp for brief phrases.- It can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room, and is pretty accurate with the wake word (I've been using Alexa)- As a music player, its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up, without having to hunt through a playlist, connect to the bluetooth speaker etc.- Purchasing music is pretty seamless. (As if Amazon needed another way to get you to spend money:-) )- iHeart radio integration, if you're into that kinda thingHere is what is not so great:- Speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts, maybe because of my accent. (e.g. Alexa, play the song The Troubles by U2- As a music player, its a bit lacking in bass.- Sometimes, while its playing music, you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention- Bing search Really *rolls eyes*I'd love to see in the future:- Integration with Fire TV, so that I can simply say Alexa, play The Sopranos on my TV- Google search- Being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts Alexa, message XYZ blah blah blahOverall, its a pretty cool product, and I'd love to see what it looks like over time!",Its like living in the future!,positive
28534,,Amazon,5.0,"When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more",Useful for commanding the Echo from another room 104 people found this helpful.

28535,,Amazon,5.0,"This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more",Very happy with Echo purchase 167 people found this helpful.

28536,,Amazon,5.0,"I had ordered the Echo and from what I had read I did not think I would need the Remote. The Echo works great if you are in the same Room. I like to listen to Music while I am cooking, cleaning, or doing nothing. I always had to go back in the same room to where my Echo was to change or skip to the next Song if I wanted. With the Remote I can change it from any room. I just stick it in my Pocket and take it out when I want to switch, turn it down or up. Connects through Blue Tooth very quickly. Has a magnetic holder to keep the Remote on (mine is on my Desk Leg) to keep it when not in use.

28548,,Amazon,5.0,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the ‘Helpful’ button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this.
